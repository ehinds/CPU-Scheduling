# CPU-Scheduling
Scheduling algorithms designed to simulate a First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) for 8 different processor values (containing a CPU burst and I/O time) that are hardcoded. Uses a circular queue class that is also available as its own repository here on github. The programs also have various calculations such as CPU utilization, response times, turnaround times, and wait times.
