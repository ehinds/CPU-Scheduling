# CPU-Scheduling
Scheduling algorithms designed to simulate a First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) for 8 different processor values (containing a CPU burst and I/O time) that are hardcoded. Uses a circular queue class that is also available as its own repository here on github.
